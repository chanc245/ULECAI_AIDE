II.Evolution of AIDE
a. AIDE v0.01: Generative Pre-trained Transformer 
In its initial form, AIDE v0.01 functioned primarily as a generative pre-trained transformer. This early version required explicit user inputs through specific websites or platforms, such as Notion AI or ChatGPT. It was capable of understanding and responding to direct queries, making it a valuable tool for information retrieval and basic task assistance.
b. AIDE v0.11 : Expansion to Limited Devices
The subsequent iteration, AIDE v0.11, marked a significant leap in capability. This version lived on a limited set of devices, such as computers and phones, and began to self-learn from user interactions. By observing and analyzing the user's work patterns, AIDE v0.11 could offer more tailored and contextually relevant assistance. This version laid the groundwork for more advanced machine learning techniques and user experience personalization.
c. AIDE v1.00 : Integration with Web 7.0 and Universal Connectivity
AIDE v1.00 represents the zenith of its evolution, fully integrating with Web 7.0 technology. This version brings the concept of a universally connected AI to life, making AIDE available across a vast array of internet-connected devices. Here, AIDE’s power of advanced connectivity offers more comprehensive and anticipatory assistance, far beyond its initial capabilities. This culmination reflects a transformative leap from a query-based AI to an omnipresent, interactive companion, capable of sophisticated interaction and proactive assistance in various aspects of daily life.
